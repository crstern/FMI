# Predictive Models
Building, interpreting and comparing simple and multiple linear regression models. For this analysis we used the 'rock' dataset (contains measurements for 48 rock samples
from an oil tank) which comes by default with R.

## About the project <br>
&emsp; The data set for this case study were intended to answer at least the following questions:
* What values need to be considered to determine which rocks will make a good reservoir? A rock that
it is both porous and permeable it would make a good accumulation rock because it allows oil and
the gas to move up through the pores of the rock, closer to the surface from which it can be extracted.
* What is the interrelation (correlation) between the shape of the pore space and the permeability of a rock? But the one between them
pore area, their shape and the permeability of a rock?
